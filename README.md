# avsampler
Processing sketch for ARCH 1477 || a lightweight audio and video sampler.

The sketch relies on minim.library  to generate sound and the synths.

All controls are mapped to the keyboard and interactable with the mouse, additionally importing a LaunchControl.library 
will add functionality to control the sketch.


//Keyboard mapping.
Refer to control map to identify keyboard mapping.
All controls are also re-assignable through 'Control_map.pde'.


//Custom audio asset.
All the audio asset is in [WAVMACHINE/audio_asset/...]. To import custom samples, place the files in the audio_asset and rename the new file like the current ones. New sample will be loaded when the sketch is running.
